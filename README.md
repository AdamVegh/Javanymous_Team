# Javanymous_Team
## Welcome to our first common Java program!

At CodeCool in the next few mounths we are going to work togather on a large project every second week.  
There are ca. 25 of us, and we are devided into 5-6-personed groups.
Each group works on separate feature of the project and has its own GitHub repository.

The name of our group is Javanymous. [Task description of our group can be found here](Description.md).
